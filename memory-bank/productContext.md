# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Writing a complex novel involves managing thousands of linked entities (characters, locations, objects), temporal dependencies (plotlines), and structural rules. Traditional text editors and simple AI chatbots lack the "long-term memory" and "structured understanding" required to maintain consistency across a 100k+ word manuscript.

## Solution: The "Cursor for Novelists"
Narrative Protocol provides an IDE-like experience for writers, where the AI is not just a text generator but a context-aware partner.

### User Experience
-   **Context-Aware Chat**: The AI knows the eye color of a character introduced in Chapter 1 when you are writing Chapter 20.
-   **Proactive Critique**: The system acts as an editor, flagging plot holes or tonal inconsistencies.
-   **Structured Worldbuilding**: Entities are managed as database objects, not just text notes.

## Value Proposition
-   **Consistency**: Eliminates continuity errors via GraphRAG.
-   **Depth**: Enables more complex plotting by offloading memory tasks to the system.
-   **Speed**: accelerates drafting and editing through intelligent agent assistance.
