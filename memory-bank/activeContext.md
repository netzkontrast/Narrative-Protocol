# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initializing the codebase for the **Narrative Protocol** application.
-   Setting up Next.js 15 + React 19 environment.
-   Establishing the "Agentic" governance structure via `AGENTS.md`.
-   Implementing the core scaffolding (Memory Bank, Workflows).

## Recent Decisions
-   **Tech Stack**: Confirmed Next.js 15, React 19, Zustand, Zod, Tailwind CSS v4.
-   **Governance**: Adopting strict Agent Modes (PM, Architect, Code) defined in `AGENTS.md`.
-   **Architecture**: Following the "Narrative IDE" blueprint (Vercel AI SDK + Inngest + GraphRAG).

## Active Tasks
-   [x] Create Project Configuration (package.json, tsconfig, etc.)
-   [x] Scaffold Application Structure
-   [ ] Create `AGENTS.md` with merged rules
-   [ ] Install dependencies and verify build

## Next Steps
-   Verify the build.
-   Begin implementing the UI shell (Shadcn/UI integration).
-   Set up Inngest and Neo4j connections (Phase 2).
