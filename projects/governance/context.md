# Active Context: Governance Project

## Current State
-   **System Migration**: Successfully migrated to "Role-Based Governance v2.0".
-   **Clean Slate**: Legacy App and Memory Bank deleted.
-   **Role Structure**: Roles (`pm`, `pmo`, `architect`, `code`, `context_engineer`) are defined in `roles/`.
-   **Project Structure**: Projects are defined in `projects/`. currently only `governance` exists.

## Session Handover
-   **Next Immediate Goal**: Flesh out the "Skills" for the defined roles.
-   **Active Discussion**: Refining the "Context Engineering" workflows.

## Critical Decisions
-   **Project-Based Todos**: Tasks are managed per-project, not per-role.
-   **PM Ownership**: PM Role owns the `todo.md`.
