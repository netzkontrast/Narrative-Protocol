# Skill: Manage Todos

**Owner**: PM Role
**Trigger**: New user request, completion of a task, or project creation.

## Process

1.  **Identify Project**:
    -   Determine which project the task belongs to (e.g., `projects/governance`).
    -   If new project, create `projects/<name>/todo.md`.

2.  **Update List**:
    -   Add new items with clear Requirements and Context.
    -   Mark completed items.
    -   *Crucial*: Keep the `todo.md` as the "Single Source of Truth" for that project's state.

3.  **Architect Review (Optional)**:
    -   If the task involves complex dependencies, request **Architect Role** review before finalizing the order.
